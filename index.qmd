### Basics

**When?** 16â€“20 September 2024  
**Where?** Brno, Czech Republic  
**What?** Training school on querying data aggregated in the ARIADNE infrastructure and their spatial analysis in R

:::

Join us in Brno for a five-day *'atRium'* training school in computational archaeology, where you will gain essential coding skills in the R programming language, knowledge of archaeological data integrated into the ARIADNE research infrastructure, and fundamental spatial data analysis expertise. 
As large amounts of archaeological data have become available, spatial analysis techniques may offer valuable insights into past human behaviour and settlement patterns.
Our programme is designed to deepen your understanding of computational methods in archaeology, focusing on working in a reproducible manner using the R programming language and environment.
