The access is provided through a comprehensive data catalogue ARIADNE Portal (see the short video below for more details) and directly through a SPARQL endpoint to the linked-open data triple store ARIADNE Knowledge Base.\nOne of the goals of the training school is to enable programmatic access to these resources by introducing basics of knowledge representation in the triple store, explaining ARIADNE AO-Cat Ontology, and providing training in building SPARQL queries.\n\n\n\nAIS CR\nArchaeological information system of the Czech Republic (AIS CR) is a research infrastructure integrating digital resources and services on archaeology in the Czech Republic and as such is one of many data providers in the ARIADNE research infrastructure. AIS CR is jointly operated by the Insititutes of Archaeology of the Czech Academy of Sciences in Brno (IAB) and Prague (IAP)."

Participants should demonstrate a keen interest in conducting data analysis and processing in a structured and reproducible manner using scripting languages.\nWhile applicants with prior knowledge of R programming are encouraged to apply, the first day of the training will be dedicated to mastering the fundamentals of R and individuals who are complete beginners are welcome as well, as no prior experience is necessary. Additionally, applicants should possess a basic understanding of statistics, data organization, and geographic information systems to fully benefit from the training."

Training school on querying data aggregated in the ARIADNE infrastructure and their spatial analysis in R\n\n\nJoin us in Brno for a five-day ‘atRium’ training school in computational archaeology, where you will get essential coding skills in the R programming language, knowledge on the archaeological data integrated in the ARIADNE research infrastructure and fundamental spatial data analysis expertise. As large amounts of archaeological data are becoming available, spatial analysis techniques may offer valuable insights into past human behaviour and settlement patterns. Our programme is designed to deepen your understanding of computational methods in archaeology, focusing on working in a reproducible manner using R programming language and environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe training school is part of trans-national access scheme provided by the ATRIUM Project, it is hosted by the Archaeological Information System of the Czech Republic (AIS CR) research infrastructure at the Institute of Archaeology, Czech Acad Sci, Brno.\n\nFeel free to distribute the flyer: PDF & PNG"

This block focuses on equipping you (participants) with essential coding skills in R and introduce you to fundamental concepts in data analysis and visualization.\n\n1.1 Introduction to R and workflows\nAn introductory course to R. Anyone with minimal or no prior experience with R will be able to understand what is happening in the code and write or adapt existing code for their use case.\n\n\n1.2 Data analysis and visualization in R\nThrough hands-on workshops, you will learn basics of data manipulation with dplyr package and data visualization with ggplot2 package as well as some basics of base R. This will give you a powerfull set of tools to analyze and visualize data.\n\n\n1.3 Introduction to spatial data in R\nYou will learn how spatial data is represented in R, especially vector data as simple features in the sf package and raster data in the terra package. We will also have a look at various operations with geographic data, including reprojecting, geometry operations etc. Integral part of the workshop will be making maps in R.\n\n\n1.4 Reproducibility and good practice in data and code management\nIn the last block we will have a look at good practice in data management and code design aimed at enhancing reproducibility and reusability. Although these practices will be promoted throughout the entire school, at the end we will wrap up and name the things we did in practice and bring them into the larger context of Open Science."

Second day of the summer school will be focused on how the data is represented in the ARIADNE Knowledge Base (ARIADNE KB) and how to access it.\n\n2.1 ARIADNE & AO-Cat Ontology\nWe will start by exploring ARIADNE Portal, a catalogue interface to the ARIADNE KB. After building up notion of how data look in the ARIADNE Portal, we will delve deeper into how data is represented in the ARIADNE KB, from general notion of linked-open data to semantic data in RDF. Finally, we will explore the AO-Cat Ontology, which will give us a basis for querying the knowledge base.\n\n\n2.2 Introduction to SPARQL\nSPARQL is a query language for semantic data in RDF. You will learn very basics of SPARQL, how do the queries look, what parts are there etc. Practical examples of queries performed on the ARIADNE SPARQL endpoint will help us to understand what is possible with the query language.\n\n\n2.3 Querying ARIADNE SPARQL endpoint\nIn the workshop, you will combine the knowledge of AO-Cat ontology and SPARQL to query ARIADNE KB. At the end of the day you will be able to create and adapt various queries to obtain data from the ARIADNE KB for further analysis and re-use."

Attendees will learn advanced analytical methods, including point pattern analysis and other statistical modelling techniques for spatial data. Through practical exercises, you will gain hands-on experience in analyzing spatial data in R, exploring various spatial analysis methods, and applying these techniques to analyze ARIADNE.\n\n3.1 Analyzing spatial data in R\nThis session focuses on hands-on experience in working with spatial data in R, especially using packages sf and terra. We will practice how to read, write, manipulate, explore and visualize (etc.) spatial data in both vector and raster formats.\n\n\n3.2 Advanced spatial analysis methods\nIn this session, we will explore some of the sophisticated spatial analysis methods beyond the basics. Topics may include spatial interpolation, spatial regression, cluster analysis, etc. This will give us a basis for deeper insights into coplex spatial patterns and relationships within archaeological datasets, especially the ARIADNE data.\n\n\n3.3 Analyzing ARIADNE data in R\nOur ultimate goal is to be able to analyze archaeological data sourced from the ARIADNE Knowledge Base in R to gain meaningful insights into past human behavior and settlement patterns. In the previous blocks we were able to query and extract data from ARIADNE Knowledge Base and we will proceed by integrating this data with other local datasets and perform spatial analysis tasks using R packages such as sf, terra, stars and spatstat."
