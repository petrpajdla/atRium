The access is provided through a comprehensive data catalogue ARIADNE Portal (see the short video below for more details) and directly through a SPARQL endpoint to the linked-open data triple store ARIADNE Knowledge Base.\nOne of the goals of the training school is to enable programmatic access to these resources by introducing basics of knowledge representation in triple store, explaining ARIADNE AO-Cat Ontology, and providing training in building SPARQL queries.\n\n\n\nAIS CR\nArchaeological information system of the Czech Republic (AIS CR) is a research infrastructure integrating digital resources and services on archaeology in the Czech Republic and as such is one of many data providers in the ARIADNE research infrastructure. AIS CR is jointly operated by the Insititutes of Archaeology of the Czech Academy of Sciences in Brno (IAB) and Prague (IAP)."

All the workshops of the school will use R and this practical introduction will give you enough experience to be able to write and understand code on yourself, know where and how to look for help, read and write data to/from R, and create and export basic plots.\n\n1.1 Introduction to R and workflows\nAn introductory course to R. Anyone with minimal or no prior experience with R will be able to understand what is happening in the code and write or adapt existing code for their use case.\n\n\n1.2 Data analysis and visualization in R\nYou will learn basics of data manipulation with dplyr package and data visualization with ggplot2 package. This will give you a powerfull set of tools to analyze and visualize data.\n\n\n1.3 Introduction to spatial data in R\nYou will learn how spatial data is represented in R, especially vector data as simple features in the sf package and raster data in the terra package. We will also have a look at various operations with geographic data, including reprojecting, geometry operations etc. Integral part of the workshop will be making maps in R."

Second day of the summer school will be focused on how the data is represented in the ARIADNE Knowledge Base (ARIADNE KB) and how to access it.\n\n2.1 ARIADNE & AO-Cat Ontology\nWe will start by exploring ARIADNE Portal, a catalogue interface to the ARIADNE KB. After building up notion of how data look in the ARIADNE Portal, we will delve deeper into how data is represented in the ARIADNE KB, from general notion of linked-open data to semantic data in RDF. Finally, we will explore the AO-Cat Ontology, which will give us a basis for querying the knowledge base.\n\n\n2.2 Introduction to SPARQL\nSPARQL is a query language for semantic data in RDF. You will learn very basics of SPARQL, how do the queries look, what parts are there etc. Practical examples of queries performed on the ARIADNE SPARQL endpoint will help us to understand what is possible with the query language.\n\n\n2.3 Querying ARIADNE SPARQL endpoint\nIn the workshop, you will combine the knowledge of AO-Cat ontology and SPARQL to query ARIADNE KB. At the end of the day you will be able to create and adapt various queries to obtain data from the ARIADNE KB for further analysis and re-use."
