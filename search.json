Access is facilitated through the comprehensive data catalogue ARIADNE Portal (see the short video below for more details) and directly through a SPARQL endpoint to the linked-open data triple store, the ARIADNE Knowledge Base.\nOne of the goals of the training school is to enable programmatic access to these resources by introducing the basics of knowledge representation in the triple store, explaining the ARIADNE AO-Cat Ontology, and providing training in building SPARQL queries.\n\n\n\nAIS CR\nThe Archaeological Information System of the Czech Republic (AIS CR) is a research infrastructure integrating digital resources and services on archaeology in the Czech Republic, and as such is one of many data providers in the ARIADNE Research Infrastructure. AIS CR is jointly operated by the Institutes of Archaeology of the Czech Academy of Sciences in Brno (IAB) and Prague (IAP)."

Participants should demonstrate a keen interest in conducting data analysis and processing in a structured and reproducible manner using scripting languages.\nWhile applicants with prior knowledge of R programming are encouraged to apply, the first day of the training will be dedicated to mastering the fundamentals of R. Individuals who are complete beginners are welcome as well, as no prior experience is necessary. Additionally, applicants should have a basic understanding of statistics, data management, and geographic information systems to fully benefit from the training."

Training school on querying data aggregated in the ARIADNE infrastructure and their spatial analysis in R\n\n\nJoin us in Brno for a five-day ‘atRium’ training school in computational archaeology, where you will gain essential coding skills in the R programming language, knowledge of archaeological data integrated into the ARIADNE research infrastructure, and fundamental spatial data analysis expertise. As large amounts of archaeological data have become available, spatial analysis techniques may offer valuable insights into past human behaviour and settlement patterns. Our programme is designed to deepen your understanding of computational methods in archaeology, focusing on working in a reproducible manner using the R programming language and environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe training school is part of a trans-national access scheme provided by the ATRIUM Project, hosted by the Archaeological Information System of the Czech Republic (AIS CR) research infrastructure at the Institute of Archaeology, Czech Academy of Sciences, Brno.\n\nFeel free to distribute the flyer in PDF or PNG."

This block focuses on equipping participants with essential coding skills in R and introducing fundamental concepts in data analysis and visualisation.\n\n1.1 Introduction to R and workflows\nAn introductory course to R. Anyone with minimal or no prior experience with R will be able to understand what is happening in the code and write or adapt existing code for their use case.\n\n\n1.2 Data analysis and visualisation in R\nThrough hands-on workshops, participants will learn the basics of data manipulation with the dplyr package and data visualisation with the ggplot2 package, as well as some basics of base R. This will provide them with a powerful set of tools to analyse and visualise data.\n\n\n1.3 Introduction to spatial data in R\nParticipants will learn how spatial data are represented in R, focusing particularly on vector data as simple features in the sf package and raster data in the terra package. We will also cover various operations with geographic data, including reprojection, geometry operations, etc. An integral part of the workshop will be creating maps in R.\n\n\n1.4 Reproducibility and good practices in data and code management\nIn the final block, we will explore good practices in data management and code design aimed at enhancing reproducibility and reusability. Although these practices will be promoted throughout the school, we will summarise and contextualise them within the larger framework of Open Science at the end of the workshop."

The second day of the summer school will focus on how the data are represented in the ARIADNE Knowledge Base (ARIADNE KB) and how to access them.\n\n2.1 ARIADNE & AO-Cat Ontology\nWe will begin by exploring the ARIADNE Portal, a catalogue interface to the ARIADNE KB. After gaining an understanding of how data look in the ARIADNE Portal, we will delve deeper into how data are represented in the ARIADNE KB, from the general concept of linked-open data to semantic data in RDF. Finally, we will explore the AO-Cat Ontology, which will provide a basis for querying the knowledge base.\n\n\n2.2 Introduction to SPARQL\nSPARQL is a query language for semantic data in RDF. Participants will learn the basics of SPARQL, including query structure and components, etc. Practical examples of queries performed on the ARIADNE SPARQL endpoint will help us understand the capabilities of the query language.\n\n\n2.3 Querying the ARIADNE SPARQL endpoint\nIn the workshop, participants will utilise their knowledge of the AO-Cat ontology and SPARQL to query the ARIADNE KB. By the end of the day, they will be able to create and adapt various queries to retrieve data from the ARIADNE KB for further analysis and re-use."

Through practical exercises, they will gain hands-on experience in analysing spatial data in R, exploring various spatial analysis methods, and applying these techniques to analyse the ARIADNE data.\n\n3.1 Analysing spatial data in R\nThis session focuses on hands-on experience in working with spatial data in R, particularly using the packages sf and terra. We will practice reading, writing, manipulating, exploring and visualising spatial data in both vector and raster formats.\n\n\n3.2 Advanced spatial analysis methods\nWe will explore sophisticated spatial analysis methods beyond the basics. Topics may include spatial interpolation, spatial regression, cluster analysis, etc. This will provide a foundation for deeper insights into complex spatial patterns and relationships within archaeological datasets, especially the ARIADNE data.\n\n\n3.3 Analysing ARIADNE data in R\nOur ultimate goal is to analyse archaeological data sourced from the ARIADNE Knowledge Base in R to gain meaningful insights into past human behaviour and settlement patterns. In the previous blocks, we were able to query and extract data from the ARIADNE KB. We will proceed by integrating such data with other local datasets and performing spatial analysis tasks using R packages such as sf, terra, stars, and spatstat."
