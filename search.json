The access is provided through a comprehensive data catalogue ARIADNE Portal (see the short video below for more details) and directly through a SPARQL endpoint to the linked-open data triple store ARIADNE Knowledge Base.\nOne of the goals of the training school is to enable programmatic access to these resources by introducing basics of knowledge representation in triple store, explaining ARIADNE AO-Cat Ontology, and providing training in building SPARQL queries.\n\n\n\nAIS CR\nArchaeological information system of the Czech Republic (AIS CR) is a research infrastructure integrating digital resources and services on archaeology in the Czech Republic and as such is one of many data providers in the ARIADNE research infrastructure. AIS CR is jointly operated by the Insititutes of Archaeology of the Czech Academy of Sciences in Brno (IAB) and Prague (IAP)."
