## Who should apply

::: {.callout-tip}

## Note

Only applicants with institutional affiliation **outside of the Czech Republic** are eligible to receive funding due to the *trans-national* nature of the access to the infrastructure provided by the school.
:::

We welcome applications from early-career researchers and PhD students who are enthusiastic about acquiring programming skills, particularly in the R scripting language, to efficiently retrieve and analyze extensive spatial datasets. 
Participants should demonstrate a keen interest in conducting data analysis and processing in a structured and reproducible manner using scripting languages. 

While applicants with prior knowledge of R programming are encouraged to apply, the first day of the training will be dedicated to mastering the fundamentals of R and individuals who are complete beginners are welcome as well, as no prior experience is necessary. 
Additionally, applicants should possess a basic understanding of statistics and geographic information systems to fully benefit from the training.
