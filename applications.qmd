## Who should apply

::: {.callout-important}
Only applicants with institutional affiliation **outside of the Czech Republic** are eligible to recieve funding due to the *trans-national* nature of the access to the infrastructure provided by the school.
:::

We invite especially early-career researchers and PhD students eager to learn how to programmaticaly (using R scripting language) get and analyze large spatial data sets to apply to the training school. 
We expect participants to be interested in data analysis and processing in a formalized and reproducible manner using a scripting language.
Applicants with prior knowledge of R programming are welcome, although the first day of the training will be devoted to learning the nuts and bolts of R, so even complete beginners are not discouraged from applying.
We expect that you will have basic knowledge of statistics and geographic information systems.
