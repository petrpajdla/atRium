title: "Training school programme"
---

The training school will last 5 days and consists of three distinct blocks (described in detail below) in which the participants will learn how to code in the R programming language, query data from the ARIADNE Knowledge Base, and analyze it using various spatial analysis methods, especially point pattern analysis.

## 1. R programming & general topics

[R is a programming language](https://cran.r-project.org/){.external} and an environment for statistical computing and graphics.
This block focuses on equipping you (participants) with essential coding skills in R and introduce you to fundamental concepts in data analysis and visualization. 

### 1.1 Introduction to R and workflows

An introductory course to R.
Anyone with minimal or no prior experience with R will be able to understand what is happening in the code and write or adapt existing code for their use case.

### 1.2 Data analysis and visualization in R

Through hands-on workshops, you will learn basics of data manipulation with [`dplyr` package](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/){.external} and data visualization with [`ggplot2` package](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/){.external} as well as some basics of base R. 
This will give you a powerfull set of tools to analyze and visualize data.

### 1.3 Introduction to spatial data in R

You will learn how spatial data is represented in R, especially vector data as simple features in the [`sf` package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/){.external} and raster data in the [`terra` package](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/index.html){.external}.
We will also have a look at various operations with geographic data, including reprojecting, geometry operations etc.
Integral part of the workshop will be making maps in R.

### 1.4 Reproducibility and good practice in data and code management

In the last block we will have a look at good practice in data management and code design aimed at enhancing reproducibility and reusability.
Although these practices will be promoted throughout the entire school, at the end we will wrap up and name the things we did in practice and bring them into the larger context of Open Science.


## 2. ARIADNE data

[ARIADNE](about.qmd#ariadne){.external} infrastructure aggregates and integrates large amounts of archaeology data worldwide. 
Second day of the summer school will be focused on how the data is represented in the ARIADNE Knowledge Base *(ARIADNE KB)* and how to access it. 

### 2.1 ARIADNE & AO-Cat Ontology

We will start by exploring [ARIADNE Portal](https://portal.ariadne-infrastructure.eu/){.external}, a catalogue interface to the ARIADNE KB.
After building up notion of how data look in the ARIADNE Portal, we will delve deeper into how data is represented in the ARIADNE KB, from general notion of linked-open data to semantic data in [RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/){.external}.
Finally, we will explore the [AO-Cat Ontology](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.7818374){.external}, which will give us a basis for querying the knowledge base.

### 2.2 Introduction to SPARQL

[SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/){.external} is a query language for semantic data in [RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/){.external}.
You will learn very basics of SPARQL, how do the queries look, what parts are there etc.
Practical examples of queries performed on the ARIADNE SPARQL endpoint will help us to understand what is possible with the query language.

### 2.3 Querying ARIADNE SPARQL endpoint 

In the workshop, you will combine the knowledge of AO-Cat ontology and SPARQL to query ARIADNE KB.
At the end of the day you will be able to create and adapt various queries to obtain data from the ARIADNE KB for further analysis and re-use.


## 3. Spatial analysis

Building upon the foundational knowledge gained in the previous blocks, this segment delves deeper into spatial analysis. 
Attendees will learn advanced analytical methods, including point pattern analysis and other statistical modelling techniques for spatial data. 
Through practical exercises, you will gain hands-on experience in analyzing spatial data in R, exploring various spatial analysis methods, and applying these techniques to analyze ARIADNE.

### 3.1 Analyzing spatial data in R

This session focuses on hands-on experience in working with spatial data in R, especially using packages [`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/){.external} and [`terra`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/index.html){.external}.
We will practice how to read, write, manipulate, explore and visualize (etc.) spatial data in both vector and raster formats.

### 3.2 Advanced spatial analysis methods

In this session, we will explore some of the sophisticated spatial analysis methods beyond the basics. 
Topics may include spatial interpolation, spatial regression, cluster analysis, etc. 
This will give us a basis for deeper insights into coplex spatial patterns and relationships within archaeological datasets, especially the ARIADNE data.

### 3.3 Analyzing ARIADNE data in R

Our ultimate goal is to be able to analyze archaeological data sourced from the ARIADNE Knowledge Base in R to gain meaningful insights into past human behavior and settlement patterns. 
In the previous blocks we were able to query and extract data from ARIADNE Knowledge Base and we will proceed by integrating this data with other *local* datasets and perform spatial analysis tasks using R packages such as [`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/){.external}, [`terra`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/index.html){.external}, [`stars`](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/index.html){.external} and [`spatstat`](https://spatstat.org/){.external}.


## Keynote lecture

Will be given by **Michael Kempf** on Wednesday, 18th September at 5:30pm as part of the *Science pub* series at the institute followed by a social event.
